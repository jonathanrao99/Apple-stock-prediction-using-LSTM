## 🚀 What's This All About?

Ever wondered if you could predict the future of Apple's stock price? Well, this project does exactly that! Using cutting-edge **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks, we analyze historical Apple stock data to predict future price movements. It's like having a crystal ball for the stock market! 🔮

### 🎯 Key Features

- **📊 Multi-variate Analysis**: Uses multiple features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adj Close)
- **🧠 Deep Learning**: LSTM neural networks for sophisticated pattern recognition
- **📈 Real-time Predictions**: Predicts the next day's stock price
- **🎨 Interactive Visualizations**: Beautiful charts using Plotly
- **📱 Easy to Use**: Simple Jupyter notebook interface
- **🔬 Scientific Approach**: Proper train/test splits and evaluation metrics

## 📊 Project Overview

### Data Features Used
- **Open Price**: Opening price of the day
- **High Price**: Highest price during the day
- **Low Price**: Lowest price during the day
- **Close Price**: Closing price of the day
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded
- **Adjusted Close**: Price adjusted for dividends and splits

### Model Architecture
